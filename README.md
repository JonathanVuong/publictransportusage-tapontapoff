Data Analysis: The Usage of Various Transports within NSW, and The Relationship between Tap-on and Tap-off of Opal Cards

Group Members: Hai Hoang Nguyen, Dong Ha Nguyen Luu, Xuyen Linh Huynh, Xuan Dung Vuong

Our goal for this project is to analyse different sections of the transport usage in NSW. We will build the model to see if there is a relationship between the tap-on and tap-off rates of Opal uses within four suburbs in NSW (Parramatta, Strathfield, Chatswood and Macquarie Park). In addition, we will compare the total uses of different transport modes in NSW, for example - the uses of trains and buses monthly, and analyse the relationship between transport uses and demography (such as age group or income).

Outline of the project:  

1.	Examine and explain the different patterns of transport usage including train, bus, light rail and ferry in specific parts and regions of NSW.
2.	Identify if there is any relationship between the age and income of citizens and their preferred modes of public transport to travel to work. Additionally, predict the volume of use of public transport based on the age and income of citizens.
3.	Perform an analysis of the number of tap-ons and tap-offs in three weeks in four different areas in NSW.
