Data Analysis: The Usage of Various Transports within NSW, and The Relationship between Tap-on and Tap-off of Opal Cards

Group Members: Hai Hoang Nguyen, Dong Ha Nguyen Luu, Xuyen Linh Huynh, Xuan Dung Vuong

Our goal for this project is to analyse different sections of the transport usage in NSW. We will build the model to see if there is a relationship between the tap-on and tap-off rates of Opal uses within four suburbs in NSW (Parramatta, Strathfield, Chatswood and Macquarie Park). In addition, we will compare the total uses of different transport modes in NSW, for example - the uses of trains and buses monthly, and analyse the relationship between transport uses and demography (such as age group or income).
